EXECUTE sp_addextendedproperty @name = N'MS_Description', @value = N'This table stores "pushdown''s". A pushdown is an attempt by the administrator to push-out a value to all users of the global or user_role level. When a change is made by the administrator to a security setting at the global or category level, the default is to "push out" the new value to all users affected by that level. However, there are times when an administrator may want to make a change to the value for a level, but leave the current user''s value alone. A pushdown record is removed once a user logs in. Pushdown''s could be proprogated to the actual int_security table as soon as possible, but this would require a lot of processing time during each change made at the global or category levels.', @level0type = N'SCHEMA', @level0name = N'dbo', @level1type = N'TABLE', @level1name = N'int_security_pushdown';
